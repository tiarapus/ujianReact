This is my final project on integrating React.js for the fundamental frontend of a web application and Express.js for the backend. 
I've developed a web-based app called "Cuitan" that utilizes CRUD operations, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete posts.
For the database management system, I've opted for MySQL. To ensure smooth integration and functionality, I've utilized Postman to thoroughly test
the API endpoints before they are consumed by the frontend.
